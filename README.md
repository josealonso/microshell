microshell is a very simple Linux shell written in C language. It's a project required for the Operating System Course at my University (http://www.uah.es). If you want to see the functionalities of the shell, along with some design requirements, take a look at the doc/ folder.

To compile the shell, simply run:

make

And the executable called msh will be created.
